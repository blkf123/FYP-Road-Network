Project Set up Instructions
-------------------------------
# 1. INSTALL REACT

   1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (LTS version recommended)
   2. Open command prompt and verify installation:
      - node --version
      - npm --version
   3. Create new React app:
      - npx create-react-app flowx
      OR if project exists:
      - cd flowx
      - npm install react react-dom

# 2. CREATE ENVIRONMENT FILES

      This project requires two `.env` files: one for the frontend and another for the backend. Follow the 
      steps below to create these files:

      #### 1. Frontend Environment File
      
      1. Navigate to the `FlowX` directory in your project.
      2. Create a file named `.env` in the `FlowX` directory (if it does not already exist).
      3. Add the following content to the file:
         - REACT_APP_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
         -create MONGODB_URI variable and set its value to the connection string.
         -create TOMTOM_API_KEY variable and set its value to the connection string.
      
      #### 2. Backend Environment File
      
      1. Navigate to the `FYP-Code` directory in your project.
      2. Create a file named `.env` (if it does not already exist).
      3. Add the following content to the file:
         -create MONGODB_URI variable and set its value to the connection string.
         -create TOMTOM_API_KEY variable and set its value to the connection string.

# Make sure you have the following Folder Structure before running the application

   Project Folder: FYP-Code

    |-- FlowX (Frontend Folder)
        |-- node_modules
        |-- public
        |-- src
        |-- .env (Frontend Environment File)
        |-- .gitignore
        |-- bikini_bottom.xml
        |-- package-lock.json
        |-- package.json
        |-- README.md

    |-- Models
    |-- tests
    |-- .env (Backend Environment File)
    |-- app.py
    |-- requirements.txt
    |-- settings.bat
    |-- singapore_graph.pkl
|-- FYPVenv


RUNNING THE APPLICATION

1. open command prompt in vscode, change directory to FYPvenv/Scripts, run `activate.bat`
2. cd to FYP-Code, run `settings.bat` or run `flask run`

        <!---- Optional Step : YOU CAN SKIP THIS IF YOU FACE NO ERRORS-----!>

         If you face errors while running the application, the included `FYPvenv` virtual environment is not working properly. Here, you can create a new virtual environment manually. 

         Follow these steps:
         
            1. Change directory to FYPvenv/Scripts in command prompt, run `deactivate.bat` to deactivate it.
            2. Delete the current FYPvenv folder from your project.
            3. Change the directory back to the root 'FYP-ROAD-NETWORK' in command prompt.      
            4. Please make sure that you have the python version--3.9 in your device. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:
               ```
               C:\Users\<Name>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\python.exe -m venv FYPvenv
               ```
               After this , the new virtual environment is created and its folder will be placed in your project. 
            5. change directory to FYPvenv/Scripts, run `activate.bat` .
           
         In this case, the virtual environment will be activated and ready for use. Please repeat the step 2 again.

3. open powershell, cd to Flowx, run `npm start`


TO RUN unittest `tests' folder

1. cd to tests 
2. run python -m unittest FILENAME.py -v
3. Pass = success, Fail = fail
