# Traffic Bottleneck Identification on Road Network

## Overview
This is the final year project done by **FYP (S4â€™2024-GROUP09)** from **UOW, Australia**.

This project is a **Traffic Bottleneck Identification System** designed to analyze real-time and historical traffic data to detect congestion points in a road network. The system helps optimize traffic flow by suggesting alternative routes when bottlenecks occur.

## Features
- **Map Importing**: Allows users to upload `.xml` map files.
- **Shortest Path Calculation**: Computes the optimal route from a selected start to end point.
- **Traffic Simulation**: Simulates vehicle movement and detects traffic congestion.
- **Bottleneck Identification**: Analyzes real-time and historical traffic data to find congested areas.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Render (for hosting backend and frontend)

## Installation

Please refer to **SET UP.txt** for detailed setup instructions.

### Prerequisites
